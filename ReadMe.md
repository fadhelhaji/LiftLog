## App Name and Description
**LiftLog** is a macro and wellness tracking app designed to help users log their workouts, track daily nutrition. Users can create personalized workout and meal plans, set fitness goals, and view their performance on a dashboard.

- I built LiftLog because I go to the gym and found it hard to find simple tracking apps that don’t require payment. This app provides an easy, free solution for anyone who wants to track their fitness journey without subscriptions or complicated interfaces.
